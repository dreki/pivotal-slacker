Changelog
=========

1.9.5
- Lock version of rainbow to 1.99.1, for compatibility's sake. New versions caused crashes.

1.9.4 (nee 1.9.3, nee 1.9.2)
- Include activeresource as a dependency. Should've been included and was causing crashes for those who didn't already have it.

1.9.1
- Updating activesupport dependency to specifically reference a 3.2.x version so as to avoid 4.x errors on install.

1.9.0
- Added "unscheduled" to default scope (e.g. when running `mine`). It seems like they should be included here and didn't used to be.

1.8.3
- Add missing `commander` to dependencies. Sorry about that.

1.8.2
- `show` and commands that list stories (e.g. `mine`) now display labels (aka tags).

1.8.1
- `create` now supports the `--backlog` option. Specifying this option causes the newly created story to be placed at the top of the topmost Backlog iteration.

1.8.0
- Add the `estimate` command. Example: `pivotal-slacker estimate 123 --points 1`
- Shell mode no longer bails out when you run a command incorrectly (e.g. with missing required options).
- Reports any errors encountered when running the `start` command. Now when you try to start an unestimated feature, you'll get an error message about it.

1.7.1
- Bugfix: In shell mode, stories were becoming cached. That has been fixed.
- Bugfix: `open` wasn't working correctly in shell mode.

1.7.0
- Add new `shell` mode. Run `pivotal-slacker shell` to access it. Enter commands as normal once in shell mode.

In shell mode, you can enter "menu numbers" for stories instead of the story IDs. I added this mode because copying and pasting story IDs significantly affects ease of use.

Menu numbers for stories print to the left of stories when running listing commands -- e.g. `mine`, `started`, etc. You can then run commands like `show 1` (where "1." is listed to the left of the story you're interested in) instead of `show 456123` (which is an example of a Pivotal Tracker story ID.)

Shell mode comes with Readline support, so you can go back through the history of your current `shell` session.

1.6.0
- Add story type to `show`

1.5.0
- Add story type to story list output (e.g. affects `mine`, `started`, etc.)

1.4.0
- Add `unstarted` command

1.3.0
- Add `started` command

1.2.0
